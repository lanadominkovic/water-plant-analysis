# Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on recalculating data from a wastewater treatment plant, incorporating both original calculations and new data from the `signali3` dataset. The analysis aims to assess the performance of the treatment process, evaluate the quality of the effluent, and estimate the associated costs.

## Data Inputs
The analysis utilizes various input parameters related to the inflow and characteristics of the wastewater, including:

- `dotok`: Daily inflow characteristics such as volume (`Q` in m³/d), temperature (`T` in °C), and concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (`COD` in g/m³), ammonium nitrogen (`NH4` in g/m³), total nitrogen (`TN` in g/m³), insoluble matter (`TSS` in g/m³), and total phosphorus (`TP` in g/m³).
- `pretok`: Parameters related to the pretreatment process, including time (`t` in days) and volumes for different process streams.
- `kisik`: Oxygen demand parameters at different stages of the treatment process.
- `iztok`: Characteristics of the treated effluent, including its volume and contaminant concentrations.
- `kvaliteta`: The environmental quality index (`EQI` in kgPU/d) indicating the quality of the effluent.
- `stroski`: Cost estimates associated with the treatment process, including various operational costs.

## Analysis Objective
The goal is to understand the efficiency and effectiveness of the wastewater treatment process, identify areas for improvement, and provide insights into the environmental and economic impacts of the plant's operation.

## Methods

The analysis of the wastewater treatment plant data employs a comprehensive approach combining data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and modeling to evaluate the efficiency and output quality of the treatment processes. Key steps in the analysis include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring data for analysis, including handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and aggregating data from multiple sources.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Examining the distribution and variance of key parameters to understand the characteristics of the wastewater input and treated effluent.
- **Modeling**: Applying predictive models to estimate the performance of the treatment process under varying conditions. (Random Forests)
- **Visualization**: Creating graphical representations of data trends, process efficiencies, and output quality to aid in interpretation and decision-making.

These methods are implemented using Python, utilizing libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for any machine learning-based analysis. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform both immediate operational decisions and long-term strategic planning for the wastewater treatment facility.
